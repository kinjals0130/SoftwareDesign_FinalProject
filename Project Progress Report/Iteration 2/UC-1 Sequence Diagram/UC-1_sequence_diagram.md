# UC-1: System Availability
The diagram below shows an initial sequence diagram for UC-1 (System Availability). As shown, the technician makes sure the system is available at all times and that the time servers are not running into traps. The interaction  starts with  a  Timeserver  sending  a trap, which  is received  by  the Technician . If TimeServers.trap==true, then the technician initiates downtime for the system.

From the interactions identified in the diagram above, initial methods for the interfaces of the interacting elements are identified in the following table: 
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Element</b></td>
        <td><b>Method Name</b></td>
        <td><b>Description</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>System</td>
        <td>
            boolean isAvailable()
            <br><br>
            boolean startDownTime()
        </td>
        <td>
            Infinitely checks if all the components of the system are available and returns a status boolean 
            <br><br>
            When called the system in under downtime, is can be due to traps that are addressed immediately by developers 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Time Servers</td>
        <td>
            boolean isTrap()
        </td>
        <td>
            Checks if a trap is detected and return the status as a boolean ‘trap’
        </td>
    </tr>
