# UC-7: Ticket Selection
The UML sequence diagram shown in the diagram below shows the system and payment components satisfying UC-7 (Ticket Selection) where the User interacts with the system to select the type of ticket they want (Regular, 3D, D-Box, IMAX, Atmos). The User is asked to GetRegistered() if they are not registered and  already do not have a Login(). After the user has selected their movie and seats approved by the administrator through the **System**, they then proceed to **Payment** where they MakePayment() and then Logout() once everything is approved.

From the interactions identified in diagram above, methods for the interfaces of the interacting elements are identified in the following table:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Element</b></td>
        <td><b>Method Name</b></td>
        <td><b>Description</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>System</td>
        <td>
            void Login(String username, String password)
            <br><br>
            void GetRegistered(String username, String password, String email)
            <br><br>
            void Logout()
        </td>
        <td>
            Logs users into the system allowing them access to book movies.
            <br><br>
            If the user is trying to book a ticket and is not already registered into the system they are prompted to register by entering their desired username, password, and email.
            <br><br>
            Logs out the user denying them access to book tickets.

    <tr>
        <td>Payment</td>
        <td>
            boolean MakePayment(String paymentType, int cardNo, int cvv)
        </td>
        <td>
            For the user to make a payment they must enter the type of payment theyâ€™d like to make the payment with plus they must also enter their card number and cvv. This function returns a confirmation status upon verifying the payment.
