# Iteration 3: Addressing Quality Attribute Scenario Driver
This iteration builds on the fundamental structural decisions made in iterations 1 and 2 by focusing on one of the quality attribute scenarios.

## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
This iteration will focus on the **QA-4 (Performance)** quality attribute scenario. QA-4 states that the website must be able to produce transactions and display tickets in a timely manner. There should be little delay, <1 minute, when performing these transactions.

## Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine
The elements to be refined in this iteration will be the physical nodes identified in iteration 1, which are the time servers and database servers.  

## Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers
The design concepts used in this iteration are indicated in the table below:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Design Decision and Locations</b></td>
        <td><b>Rationale and Assumptions</b></td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Introducing an element from the <b>message queue</b>.
        </td>
        <td>
            Tickets received from the time servers are placed in the message queue then later retrieved by the application. Use of a queue will guarantee that tickets are processed and delivered in a timely manner. 
        </td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Introducing the <b>performance</b> tactic by <b>prioritizing events</b>.
        </td>
        <td>
            Prioritizing transactions by importance of events according to the service provided to the user. Ticket booking transactions made first will get processed first (according to the time).
        </td>
    <tr>
<table>

## Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces
The instantiation design decisions made in this iteration are summarized in the following table:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Design Decision and Locations</b></td>
        <td><b>Rationale and Assumptions</b></td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Deploy message queue on a separate node
        </td>
        <td>
            Doing so will guarantee that no transaction data will be lost in the case that the time servers are down according to CON-3. 
        </td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Identifying the events to be prioritized.
        </td>
        <td>
            Create the prioritization scheme to rank the order of services according to importance. 
        </td>
    <tr>
<table>
